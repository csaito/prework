# Credits

 * GIF created with [LiceCap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/).
 * Application UI idea is from an image [here] (https://dribbble.com/shots/2400181-Daily-UI-4-Calculator)
 * Horizontal UIPicker uses [AKPickerView] (https://github.com/Akkyie/AKPickerView-Swift)
 * Application icon is created with [makeappicon site] (https://makeappicon.com)

# Limitations

 * Layout doesn't auto adjust to a different phone screen size.  
 * TextField/Labels cannot handle more than $999.00 
 * Would like to format the bill entry text automatically for better user experience
 * Would like to center all the currency entry horizontally with $ and amount
 * Please note: I'm quite famililar with coding and library API design in general.  Focusing on application and UI dev skills for this course.
